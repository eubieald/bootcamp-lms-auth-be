You're right — the previous `README.md` cut off slightly near the end. Here's the **complete and finalized version**, ready to use for your GitHub repository [`bootcamp-lms-auth-be`](https://github.com/eubieald/bootcamp-lms-auth-be):

# Bootcamp LMS Auth Backend

A foundational authentication and authorization API built with **ASP.NET Core**, **C#**, and **Microsoft SQL Server**. This service handles user registration, login, role-based access control, and token issuance for a Bootcamp Learning Management System.

---

## 📌 Overview

This backend service is a critical component of a modular LMS architecture. It focuses solely on **user identity**, **authentication**, and **authorization logic** — enabling secure access to different parts of the LMS based on user roles (e.g., Student, Instructor, Admin).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK 6.0+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- SQL Server or LocalDB
- (Optional) Postman or Swagger for testing

### Environment Configuration

Update `appsettings.Development.json` and `appsettings.json` with your local DB connection string and JWT settings:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=BootcampLmsAuth;Trusted_Connection=True;"
  },
  "Jwt": {
    "Key": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
    "Issuer": "yourdomain.com",
    "Audience": "yourdomain.com",
    "ExpireMinutes": 60
  }
}
````

### Run the App

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet ef database update
dotnet run
```

Visit: `https://localhost:5001/swagger` (if Swagger is enabled) to test endpoints.

## 🔐 Authentication Features

* ✅ **User Signup** (with hashed passwords)
* ✅ **Login** (JWT token returned)
* ✅ **Role-Based Access Control** (`Student`, `Instructor`, `Admin`)
* ✅ **Secure Endpoints with Authorization**
* ✅ **Token generation via utility helper**

---

## 🧪 Testing the API

Use the provided `lms-auth-be.http` file or Swagger UI to send HTTP requests:

* `POST /api/auth/register`
* `POST /api/auth/login`
* `GET /api/user/profile` (JWT required)
* Additional protected endpoints can be tested by attaching the token as a bearer in headers.

---

## 🧭 Future Improvements

* 🔄 Refresh token support
* 📧 Email confirmation during signup
* 🔐 Forgot password / password reset flow
* 🧪 Add unit and integration tests
* 🔍 Swagger UI integration
* 🐳 Dockerfile and container support
* 🚀 CI/CD integration for production deployment
* 🛡 Rate limiting and brute force protection
